                        <h3>Kinetic Core Stability</h3>
                        <p>A multi-density midsole system featuring an internal, semi-rigid Carbon Plate that runs from the heel to the forefoot. The plate is angled to absorb and immediately return force during the eccentric (landing) and concentric (jumping) phases, maximizing vertical lift. The denser foam on the medial and lateral edges acts as a stability wing, scientifically preventing ankle rolling during quick cuts and defensive slides.</p>

                        <h3>Titan Weave Upper</h3>
                        <p>An advanced upper material constructed from a specialized, high-tenacity polymer fiber (like a reinforced, engineered mesh).
                    
                    It is strategically woven with varying densities: high-abrasion zones (like the toe box and side walls) are densely reinforced for durability, while flexible zones (over the instep) allow for dynamic movement and agility.
                    
                    This delivers the "Ground Yourself in Stone" stability without sacrificing breathability.</p>

                        <h3>Vector-Grip Outsole</h3>
                        <p>An outsole made of highly durable, non-marking rubber designed with a scientifically mapped multi-directional traction pattern.
                    
                    The pattern features deep, angular grooves and micro-siping specifically calculated to maximize grip for forward acceleration, instantaneous stops, and lateral push-offsâ€”the three most critical movements in volleyball.
                    
                    The rubber compound itself is formulated for maximum lifespan against abrasive indoor court surfaces, embodying the brand's durability value.</p>
